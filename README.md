### So what exactly are stars, galaxies, and quasars?

*     <p align="justify">A GALAXY is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. Galaxies are categorised according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their active centers.</p>

*     <p align="justify">A STAR is a type of astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.

*     <p align="justify">A QUASAR, also known as a quasi-stellar object, is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN). The power radiated by quasars is enormous. A typical quasar is 27 trillion times brighter than our sun! If you were to place a quasar at the distance of Pluto, it would vaporise all of Earthâ€™s oceans to steam in a fifth of a second.

The dataset we'll be using for this model is the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucidlenn/sloan-digital-sky-survey)

<p align="justify">The data consists of 10,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS. Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar. 30% of it is used in testing the model performance and 70% in training of the model.
